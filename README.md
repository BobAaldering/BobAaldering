## Welcome to my GitHub page!

Here you can see all the projects I've made over the years. Many projects are an extension of my education, [Applied Computer Science](https://www.saxion.edu/programmes/bachelor/applied-computer-science). I am following this course at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.edu). 
Within this course you are mainly concerned with electronics that are combined with software. You already think so, embedded systems! But that in itself is not that bad, I also develop GUIs among other things, which in this case communicate with a microcontroller. Furthermore, I am personally mainly interested in C and C++ (but of course also C#).

But we stray too much (ðŸ˜Š). In my GitHub account you can see which repositories I have given a [star](https://github.com/BobAaldering?tab=stars). Also take a look at all my [repositories](https://github.com/BobAaldering?tab=repositories).

### Things I'm currently learning - ðŸŒ±

I am currently learning the following:

* ESP32 development.
* Design principles of operating systems.

### Fun facts - âš¡

I love C++ very much! Great for solving hours of research on a complex problem. And by the way, calculating, for example, electrical networks is also interesting!
